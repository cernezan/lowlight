## Wanna help me out?

This is my first React project and also my first Craft extension. I'm sure I didn't follow the best practices when it comes to React but I'm trying to improve. I'm welcoming any feedback regarding the code and the extension itself.

### Building the extension from source

Simply run `npm install` and then `npm run build` to generate the .craftX file which can be installed.
You can use `npm run dev` to test and debug in your local environment
